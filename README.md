## Introduction

Welcome to the Rock-Paper-Scissors game, a simple yet entertaining game built using JavaScript. This project showcases the use of JavaScript's core features, such as math functions, random number generation, and conditional statements.

## Game Strategy and Development Process

### Steps to Develop the Game

1. **Think about what steps we need:**
   - Understand the game rules
   - Plan the game's user interface
   - Implement the game logic
2. **Convert those steps into code:**
   - Use HTML to create the game's user interface
   - Write JavaScript code to handle user interactions and game logic

### Algorithm

The game's algorithm is based on the following steps:

1. When a user clicks a button, the computer randomly selects a move (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).
2. The computer's move is compared to the user's move to determine the winner.
3. The result is displayed in a popup.

## How to Play the Game

To play the game, simply click on one of the buttons representing Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The computer will then randomly select a move, and the winner will be displayed in a popup.

## Technologies Used

This game is built using the following technologies:

- HTML: Used to create the game's user interface
- CSS: Used to style the game's user interface
- JavaScript: Used to implement the game logic and user interactions

## Future Enhancements

In the future, we plan to enhance this game by adding the following features:

- Multiplayer mode: Allow multiple players to play against each other
- High scores: Keep track of the highest scores achieved by players
- Customizable characters: Allow players to choose their own characters and backgrounds
